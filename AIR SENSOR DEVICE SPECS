MCU: ESP32C3 or ESP32S3. S3 might be able to expose its flash as a mountable partition so configs can be written to it, but if that fails to pan out might fall back to the c3 and work with a configuration protocol to allow the mesh network of devices to configure each other

Temp/Humidity/Pressure: BM280
CO2: 
VOCs:
Particulate Matter: // PM2.5 is mandatory, but a device that can output 1, 2.5, 4, and 10 would be nice. Fan models increase power draw and maintenance needs, so PM2.5 only might be needed for a satrting point?
Dust Sensor:
NOx:
SO2:

Display: Waveshare eink B/W display. Colored ones require too much time to refesh the display, going from 2 seconds to up to over 30 per redraw. Might need to power test against a small and traditional LED display if my refresh rate is around once every 10-15 seconds... Goal is lowest power draw after all.

Screen size unknown, and likely variable depending on device config. Will have to work from the largest option first, then code for smaller ones if desired.

Battery: Some sort of Li-ion, but capacity is unknown and will require testing with different device configs and measurement settings

User Configuration: Either USB mountable flash or an SD card or something, but some way for a user to provide a txt file that can be parsed for startup data. Maybe even a built in HTTP server that allows for configuration somehow... Seems difficult to secure though?
